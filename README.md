# Baye-s-Theorem
Implement bayeâ€™s rule using python. You can consider any example

Example: Three identical boxes contain red and white balls. The 
first box contains 3 red and 2 white balls, the second box has 4 red 
and 5 white balls, and the third box has 2 red and 4 white balls. A box 
is chosen very randomly and a ball is drawn from it. If the ball that is 
drawn out is red, what will be the probability that the second box is 
chosen
